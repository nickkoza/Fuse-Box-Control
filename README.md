# Fuse Box Control
**WARNING: This prop really does contain high voltage and is extremely dangerous; using any of these designs or code is entirely at your own risk.** High voltage should always be treated with respect, and should only be used with the proper safety precautions.

This code powers a fuse-box prop that I developed. The prop has an extremely loud sparking sound, along with movement and light to startle guests. It's remotely triggered via a small remote. It also features a small speaker with a constant 60hz buzz, to make the guests uneasy as they walk by it.

This code makes use of my [Animately](https://github.com/nickkoza/animately) library, and is powered by a custom PCB with an ATmega328p chip (an Arduino, basically.) The sparking is provided by a high voltage coil from AliExpress.
